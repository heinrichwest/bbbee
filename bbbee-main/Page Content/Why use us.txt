Who is SpecCon?

SpecCon is a South African training and compliance partner that helps organisations turn B-BBEE from a headache into a working plan. We map out your level, build a realistic action roadmap, and leave you with an audit-ready file you can take to any SANAS-accredited verification agency. Our approach is practical, transparent, and built around measurable resultsâ€”no jargon, no guesswork.
