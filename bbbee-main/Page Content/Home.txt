Who is SpecCon?

SpecCon is a South African training and compliance partner that helps organisations turn B-BBEE from a headache into a working plan. We map out your level, build a realistic action roadmap, and leave you with an audit-ready file you can take to any SANAS-accredited verification agency. Our approach is practical, transparent, and built around measurable results—no jargon, no guesswork.

Why our consultants are the best in South Africa

Verification readiness baked in from day one (mock audits, document checklists, and gap-closing “quick wins”).

A trusted network for specialist needs (ESOPs/trusts, supplier enablement, disability learnerships), coordinated by your SpecCon lead.
